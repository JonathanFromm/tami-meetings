Business Status meeting [21.04.19 19:30]
========================================

Meeting is done weekly for tracking the status of the hackerspace since we are close to zero money point since losing our last major donor.

These meetings started after a major meeting we had around February about the situation, where it was agreed overhelmingly that people wanted TAMI to remain.

In order to do that we agreed on a number of measures designed to increase income and reduce expenses.

These meetings are tracking the progress of those initiatives.

What follows are the notes.
