Meeting notes starting now for the weekly meeting
(Alon writing)

Alon gave an update on our cash flow per the bank:
 start_march = 13808.36
 end_march = 6360.16
 end_march - start_march
  -7448.200000000001

 one_time_march = 4680 (accountant)

 end_march - start_march + one_time_march
 -2768.2000000000007

But some of the incoming money was people paying forward for 6 months:
 one_time_march = 4680 + ( - 1220 - 1200 - 1200) * 5.0/6
 1663.3333333333335

 end_march - start_march + one_time_march
  -5784.866666666667

In other words: assuming we do not have 3 people giving 3620 nis paying for 6 months in advance, this month
we can expect to almost drain our funds
 6380 - 5784 = 596

ronen updated about paypal:
 we have 4200. 200 goes to isaac, 1200 is sadna of Asaf, 3000 is member dues. It was 0 at 20.2 ~
 there is 7% commision, only if there is actual transfer.

Shay:
 16.4 Noam is proposing to lecture on real time (waiting for his)
 Bio hub had 2 lectures in the last month. 20 people in each.

Yonantan:
 I submitted documents for "Mosad Mitnadev" status.

 I discussed article 46, it requires a lot more paper work, I started looking into it.

  - article 46 is a status for an amuta that allows donations to count against taxes.
   - 35% of the donation amount for individuals
   - 25% for companies

  - nihul takin was submitted for 2019 (required for article 46)
   - verified to be as "in processing" status

 - have a patreon site ready to load need a little more review. Reviewers welcome!

 - Our amuta goals have been changed to increase the chance of getting the 'mosad mitnadev' status
  - the change reflects what we are doing. The original writing said things that could be taken
    as us being a members only club. The new wording makes it clear we are open for everybody.
